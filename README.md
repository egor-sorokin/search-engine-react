```
git clone <name of this repository>
cd path/to/project
npm start
```

Run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes in the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

**Note**: if it's not running try to type and run `npm i` command before start


```
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
By default, it also includes a service worker so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
There are some other commands in the *package.json* file in the project that can be useful for development.
